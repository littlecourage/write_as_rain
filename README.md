# Write As Rain

## Background and Overview: 

Write as Rain is a JavaScript web app that attempts to draw the weather. I will incorporate current weather data and attempt to synthesize the information into simple animations that express the current weather.

Features of the weather that Iâ€™d like to attempt to illustrate will include wind direction and speed, snowfall, and rain. My hope is that this program will be responsive enough to combine multiple attributes of the current weather into a cohesive animation that reflects the conditions outside.

## Functionality and MVPs:
1. Gathering weather data from MetaWeather API
2. Creating drawing individual weather elements, such as rain or show
3. Displaying the current weather conditions on the site as well as an animated image of those conditions
4. Combining multiple weather elements in order to better illustrate the current conditions, i.e. combining wind with rain to change the direction of the rain drops, and having a background color that changes throughout the day.
5. Allowing the user to choose multiple locations from a list of locations.

## Architecture and Technology:

1. JavaScript, HTML, CSS
2. MetaWeather API
3. Canvas and p5.js library


## Implementation Timeline

* Day 1: Create basic canvas animation and learn how to manipulate it in various ways
* Day 2: Research and MetaWeather API and get an idea of how I can use this data to manipulate my animations
* Day 3: Develop different ways to animate a variety of weather conditions
* Day 4: Link the data from the weather API to my drawings in canvas.
* Day 5: Streamline site so that a user can select a location from a list.

## Bonus Features: 
* The ability for user to choose any city of their choice (or their own location) and see the weather for that location
* Little figures in the weather scene that respond to the weather, such as a kite, leaves, or a snowman
